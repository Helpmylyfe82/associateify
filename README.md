Automatically adds your affiliate id to Amazon.com links on your website

To use add jquery to your website (if you don't already have it):
     <script type="text/javascript" src="jquery-1.9.1.min.js"></script>

And then add the associateify.js file:

<script type="text/javascript" src="associateify.js"></script>


If you have ajax or other events that load content on your site you may want to run "tagLinks()" from in your load complete events.


One idea on how to use this is to add it to your website forum to automatically tag posted Amazon links.
 
Please consider leaving the "tip" percent above 0 for using this code.. :)
